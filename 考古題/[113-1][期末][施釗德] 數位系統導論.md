2. (a) How many 128 * 8 ROM chips are required to construct a 2048 * 8 ROM chip? What is additionally needed and why?  (10%)
(b) A DRAM chip uses two-dimensional address multiplexing. It has 10 column address pins and 12 row address pins. What is the capacity of the memory?  (10%)
 
3. A sequential circuit has two JK flip-flops A and B and one input x. The circuit is described by the following flip-flop input equations:  JA = x’   KA = B’  JB = A   KB = x
(a) Derive the state equations A(t+1) and B(t+1) by substituting the input equations for the J and K variables.
(b) Draw the state table and state diagram of the circuit. (20%)

5. Using JK flip-flops:
(a) Draw the logic diagram of a MOD-8 counter (counting sequence: 0, 1, 2, …,7). (20%)
(b) Modify the circuit to a MOD-5 counter (counting sequence: 0, 1, 2, …4) by adding a NAND gate and with asynchronous clear. (10%)
