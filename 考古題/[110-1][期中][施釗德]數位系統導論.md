# 110-1 數位系統導論

### 一、

1. List the truth table of the function $F = x'z' + xy +yz$.
2. Express the above function in sum-of-minterms and product-of-maxterms form.
3. Draw the logic diagram of circuit that implements F.

### 二、Simplify the following Boolean functions using K-maps;

1. $F(x,y,z) = \Sigma(1,2,4,6)$
2. $F(w,x,y,z) = \Sigma(0,1,2,3,5,8,13)$
3. $F(w,x,y,z) = \Sigma(1,2,4,6,12)、d = (w,x,y,z)=\Sigma(0,3,5,7,11,15)$ where d is don't care conditions.

### 三、Design a combinatorial circuit with three inputs and one outputs

1. The output is 1 when the binary value of inputs is not divisible by 3. The output is 0 otherwise
2. The output is 1 when the input variables have more 0's than 1's.Theoutput is 0 otherwise.

### 四、$F(x,y,z) = \Sigma(1,2,6,7)$

1. Implement $F(x,y,z)$ with a decoder ad OR gates
2. Implement $F(x,y,z)$ wit a 4-1 multiplexer
