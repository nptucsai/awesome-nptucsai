# 111-1 數位系統導論

1.   
    (a) List the truth table of the function $F = x'y + xy' + xz$. (10%)   
    (b) Draw the logic diagram of circuit that implements F. (10%)   
    (c) Find the complement of F and express it in product of sums. (10%)

2. Simplify the following Boolean functions using K-maps:   
(a) $F(x,y,z)=\Sigma(0,2,3,7)$ (10%)   
(b) $F(w,x,y,z)=\Sigma(2,3,5,7,11,13)$ (10%)   
(c) $F(A,B,C,D)=ABC'D'+AB'C+B'C'D'+AB'CD+B'C'D$ (10%)

3. Design a combinational circuit with three inputs and one output.   
(a) The output is 1 when the binary value of inputs is ore than 2. The output is 0 otherwise. (10%)   
(b) The output is 1 when the binary value of the inputs is an even number. The output is 0 otherwise. (10%)

4.
    (a) Implement $F(x,y,z) = xy'z'+yz$ with a decoder and OR gates.(10%)   
    (b) Construct a 4-to-16-line decoder with five 2-to-4-line decoders with enable. (10%)
