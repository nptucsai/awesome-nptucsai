# [113-1] 數位系統導論

1. (a) List the truth table of the function F =a’b’c’+a’bc+ab’c’+ab (10%)
(b) Find the complement of F and express it in product of sums. (10%)

2. Simplify the following Boolean functions using K-maps:
(a) F(A,B,C)=S(1, 2, 3, 5, 7)  (10%)
(b) F(A,B,C,D)=S(0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11)  (10%)

3. Simplify F(A,B,C,D)=A’B+A’B’C+CD to (a) sum-of-products and (b) product-of-sums. (20%)

4. Design a combinational circuit with three inputs and one output.
(a) The output is 1 when the binary value of the inputs is less than 3. The output is 0 otherwise. (10%)
(b) The output is 1 when the inputs have more 1’s than 0’s. The output is 0 otherwise. (10%)

5. (a) Implement F(x, y, z)= S (0, 1, 5, 7) with a decoder and OR gates. (10%)
(b) Construct a 3x8 decoder using two 2x4 decoders and a NOT gate. (10%)
